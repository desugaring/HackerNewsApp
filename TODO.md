addressed points to discuss:
    ok, added to user page - add navigation controller to navigate to webview and back
    ok - document every test method to explain what it does 
    ok - remove static test inits from models - move into extension
    - no more use of dispatchqueue - @MainActor is great and something I didn't know about!
    - threading issue is resolved - how embarrassing
    
    - tests split up into separate files - one test file, one file being tested
    - HNDataProviderTests now uses do/catch and asserts to do proper testing
    
    
TODO
- use markup to document every file/class/enum
- test mock provider/extend to have some real mock data
