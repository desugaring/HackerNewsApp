HackerNews App ReadMe

How to run -

    - simply build and run using any phone simulator - no credentials/cocoapods/anything necessary

What the app is/does -

    - shows a subset of what you'd see on https://news.ycombinator.com
    - uses https://github.com/HackerNews/API for API access - no login/registration necessary

    - displays 3 tabs - New Stories, Top Stories, Users
    - lazily fetches new stories/top stories as you scroll
    - has refresh
    - has ability to add and save your favorite users (I like TheOtherHobbes :))
    - clicking on a story/user goes to its url

Basic Architecture -

    - UI <- ViewModel <- DataProvider <- Model

    - UI is written in SwiftUI and relies on view models
    
    - View Models have 3 key pieces
        - data status (show different UI based on this)
        - data
        - ability to get data (using data provider)

    - Data Providers have 2 key pieces
        - ability to get data (using http requests)
        - ability to cache data

    - Models are just simple structs that can be json encoded/decoded
    
    
Things I'd improve if I had more time -

    - I'd do proper error handling
    - I'd try to see how to de-duplicate the UI code in NewStoriesView/TopStoriesView
    - I'd add some real sample data to HNMockDataProvider to make it useful in testing
    - I'd add the comments section to stories - that's what's so great about HackerNews
    
Tests -

    - Models are tested for ability to parse from json
    - Data providers are tested for ability to get data via http requests (verify that the APIs are up, running and returning expected data)
